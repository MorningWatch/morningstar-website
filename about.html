                    <h3>The Scriptures</h3>
                    <p>
                        We believe men inspired by God wrote the Holy Bible. We hold it to be the perfect truth, without 
                        error. It is the only complete and final authority in matters of faith and practice. Furthermore, it should be highly esteemed 
                        and revered, as it contains the very words of God. When we refer to "The Holy Bible," we speak of the collection of sixty-
                        six books, from Genesis to Revelation, as originally written and providentially preserved, these books do not merely 
                        contain and convey the message of God's Word; they are the very words of God themselves. When we use the term 
                        "inspiration," we are referring to the belief that as holy men of old wrote the books of the Bible, the Holy Spirit undertook 
                        a miraculous work of placing His Spirit upon them so that forever these writings are undeniably God's words as if God 
                        Himself had penned them, breathed His life upon them, and still inhabits this living, life-giving, empowered Book. No 
                        other writings possess this inspiration by God, besides the Bible. As God inspired His Word, we believe He also preserved 
                        His words including its inspirational presence and power in the form of the English Authorized or the King James 
                        Version. We believe this Bible to be God's infallible, inerrant, preserved, inspired Scripture. 2 Timothy 3:16, Psalm 19:7, 
                        Deuteronomy 8:3, Psalm 119:89, 160, 1 Peter l :23, 1 Thessalonians 2:13, 2 Peter l: 19-21, Psalm 12:6-7.
                    </p>
                    <br />
                    <h3>Dispensationalism</h3>
                    <p>
                        We believe when the Scriptures are interpreted literally within their natural context, it 
                        becomes necessary to make divisions while studying God's words to accurately preach and teach Bible truth. These 
                        divisions are made based on the intended audience or the time period the passage was written. God has interacted with 
                        humanity in different ways at different times. These times or dispensations are defined by a unique set of expectations. 
                        These different periods or covenants with different audiences the Bible refers to as dispensations, and each provides a 
                        framework for understanding God's plan and the necessity of Salvation. In each dispensation, man is given different tests 
                        of obedience. All these tests have ended in failure. For example, in the Age of Innocence, Adam and Eve disobeyed and 
                        took of the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil. God stepped in and thus began a new dispensation. The salvation 
                        made available by God's grace in every dispensation is ultimately fulfilled by the finished sacrifice of Jesus Christ on the 
                        cross. His blood serves as the payment for the promises made to man in the former dispensations. Understanding these 
                        divisions is vital to a believer understanding his responsibilities. For instance, we are not responsible for sacrificing a 
                        lamb in the Church Age. Instead, we are to acknowledge that we are sinners before God, both by birth and by choice, and 
                        turn to God in faith, believing that the sacrifice of Jesus is sufficient for our salvation. Dispensations help us delineate the 
                        distinctions between the Old and New Testaments as well as distinctions between Jews, Gentiles, and the Church, etc. 2 
                        Tim. 2:15; Heb. 9:14-18; Gal. 3:13-25; 1 Cor. 9:17; Eph. 1:10, 3:1-10; Col 1:25.
                    </p>
                    <br />
                    <h3>The One True God</h3>
                    <p>
                        We believe that there is only one true and living God, who is the Creator of the universe. Some 
                        of God's attributes include love, justice, holiness, and wisdom. He is omniscient, omnipotent, and omnipresent, existing 
                        outside of time while interfacing with His creation within time and space and matter. We believe in the doctrine of the 
                        Trinity. Within the Godhead, there exist three coequal and coeternal persons: the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. 
                        These persons are distinct yet act in perfect harmony, especially evidenced in the work of creation, redemption, and 
                        sanctification. These three are equal in every purpose, working distinctly but cooperatively. God is not a distant deity, He 
                        is a relational God who desires a relationship with mankind, which is made possible through the life, death, and 
                        resurrection of Jesus Christ. John 5:17; John 10:30; Deuteronomy 6:4; Isaiah 45:5-6; 1 Timothy I: 17; 2 Corinthians 
                        13:14; Matthew 28:19; Ephesians 1:3-14.
                    </p>
                    <br />
                    <h3>Jesus Christ</h3>
                    <p>
                        We believe that Jesus Christ was God in the flesh. He is the second person of the Trinity, fully God, 
                        and fully man, existing eternally with the Father and the Holy Spirit. He was born of a virgin. He entered into time to 
                        redeem mankind. He lived a sinless life; He was the express image of God. Jesus willingly offered Himself as the perfect 
                        and final sacrifice for human sin through the cross of Calvary. His death on the cross satisfied the righteous demands of a 
                        holy God and provided the atonement for all men. He was physically resurrected on the third day, overcoming death. Jesus 
                        Christ secured eternal life for all who place their faith in Him. Jesus then ascended into heaven, where He sits at the right 
                        hand of God the Father, serving as our high priest and advocate. He will return again. His life, death, and resurrection are 
                        the foundation of our faith and His demonstration of love to mankind. John 1:1-3, 14, Matthew 1:18-25, Hebrews 4:15, 1 
                        Peter 2:22, Romans 5:8, 1 Corinthians 15:3-4, Hebrews 9:24-28, Acts 1:9-11, Revelation 19:11-16. 
                    </p>
                    <br />
                    <h3>The Holy Ghost</h3>
                    <p>
                        We believe the Holy Ghost or Holy Spirit is the third person of the Trinity, coequal and coeternal 
                        with God the Father and God the Son. The Holy Spirit is not an impersonal force but a distinct person with intellect, 
                        emotion, and will. He is in the world today, convicting the world of sin, righteousness, and judgment to come. The Holy 
                        Spirit indwells the believer, sealing them for the day of redemption, and is the earnest for our future inheritance. He equips 
                        believers with spiritual gifts for the edification of the Church and empowers them for godly living and effective ministry. 
                        The Holy Spirit works in the believer for his sanctification, He guides them into all truth and conforms them to the image 
                        of Christ. He intercedes on behalf of believers and bears witness to their standing before God. The Spirit illuminates the 
                        Scriptures, making the Word of God discernable to his understanding. The Holy Spirit enables believers to live in a 
                        manner that glorifies God and is consistent with His expectations. John 14:16-17, 26, John 16:7 -15, Ephesians 1:13-1, 4 1 
                        Corinthians 12:4-11, Galatians 5:16-25 Romans 8:14-27, 2 Timothy 3:16-17, 1 Corinthians 2:9-16.
                    </p>
                    <br />
                    <h3>The Devil or Satan</h3>
                    <p>
                        We believe Satan, also known as Lucifer or the Devil, is a created being who was once holy 
                        and enjoyed heavenly honors as the Anointed Cherub covering the throne of God. However, he rebelled against God out 
                        of pride and attempted to usurp God's authority, which failed. He is a real and malevolent being, not a symbolic 
                        representation of evil. Satan is the adversary of God and the accuser of God's people, constantly seeking to deceive, tempt, 
                        and destroy. He is the author of all false religions and the root of all present apostasy His powers are significant but 
                        limited by God; he is not omnipotent, omnipresent, or omniscient. Satan is the instigator of sin and evil in the world, 
                        actively working to oppose God's program and lead people away from a relationship with God. His defeat was secured 
                        through the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ. Currently, he holds the position of the prince of the power of the air and 
                        is considered the unholy god of this world. At the end of the age, Satan will be cast into the Lake of Fire, and his evil will 
                        be forever destroyed. Satan is the lord of the antichrist and the cause and director of all the powers of darkness. Satan is 
                        destined to face final defeat at the hands of God's Son and will be subject to the judgment of eternal justice in hell, a place 
                        specifically prepared for him and his angels. Ezek. 28:14-17, Isa. 14:12-15, Revelation 12:19, Eph. 2:2, 2 Cor. 4:4, Matt. 
                        4:3, 1 Pet. 5:8, 2 Cor. 11:14, Rev. 12:10, 2 Thess. 2:9, 1 John 2:22, Rev. 20:10, Matt. 25:41.
                    </p>
                    <br />
                    <h3>Creation</h3>
                    <p>
                        We believe in the creation account as given in Genesis that the universe and all it contains were created out 
                        of nothing, by God. The biblical account of creation in the book of Genesis should be interpreted literally rather than 
                        allegorically or figuratively. We believe that man was created directly in God's own image and after His own likeness. We 
                        also believe that God directly created all plant and animal life. We uphold the principle that God's established law is for 
                        these life forms to reproduce "after their kind." All of the creation was completed in six 24-hour periods. We believe that 
                        creation was instantaneous and did not need to evolve or develop over time from lower to higher forms we must take a 
                        stand against non-Biblical science and philosophy. Morning Watch will strive to guard what has been entrusted to our care 
                        by opposing what is falsely called science, specifically the vain philosophies of man called evolution and humanism. 
                        Genesis 1:1-2:25, John 1:1-3, Acts 17:28, Romans 1:20, Colossians 1:15-17, Hebrews 11:3, 1 Tim 6:20, Colossians 2:8, 
                        Genesis 1:1-31, Exodus 20:11, Psalm 19:1-4, Romans 1:19-2 0, Colossians 1:16-17, Hebrews 11:3, Isaiah 45:12, 
                        Revelation 4:11.

                    <h3>Man</h3>
                    <p>
                        We believe that man was created in God's image in a perfect environment, innocent under the law of God. 
                        However, man fell from his sinless and happy state by voluntary transgression. As a result, all mankind are now sinners, 
                        not by constraint but by choice, and are therefore under just condemnation without defense or excuse. Because of this, 
                        man needs atonement for his sin. This atonement is available through the shed blood of Jesus Christ. Jesus freely took 
                        upon Himself man's nature, yet without sin, He kept the divine law by His personal obedience and by His death made a 
                        full atonement for our sins. His atonement consisted of voluntarily substituting Himself in the sinner's place the just dying 
                        for the unjust. Christ, the Lord, bore our sins in His own body on the cross. To be saved, man must be born again; the new 
                        birth is a new creation in Christ Jesus. It is instantaneous and not a process; the one dead in trespasses and sins is made a 
                        partaker of the divine nature and receives eternal life, the free gift of God. Thus, man is restored to a relationship with 
                        God. It is man's responsibility to seek God and find him, as God has already reached out to man in the person and work of 
                        Jesus Christ and continues to draw men to Himself through the person and work of the Holy Ghost. God desires man to be 
                        restored to his original state but will not override man's free will through the heinous doctrine of undeniable grace. 
                        Genesis 1:27, Romans 3:23, Romans 6:23, John 3:16, 2 Corinthians 5:21, 1 Peter 2:24; John 3:3, 2 Peter 1:4, Romans 
                        6:23, I Timothy 2:5-6, 2 Peter 3:9, Matthew 23:37.
                    </p>
                    <br />
                    <h3>The Atonement for Sin</h3>
                    <p>
                        We believe that the salvation of sinners is wholly of grace; through the shed blood of Jesus Christ, who by appointment of the Father, freely took upon Himself our nature, yet without sin, honored the divine 
                        law by His personal obedience , and by His death made a full atonement for our sins; that His atonement consisted not in 
                        setting us an example by His death as a martyr, but was the voluntary substitution of Himself in the sinner's place, the just 
                        dying for the unjust, Christ, the Lord , bearing our sins in His own body on the cross. (Ephesians 2:8, Acts 15:11, Romans 
                        8:24, John 3:16, Matthew 18:11, Philippians 2:7, Hebrew 2:14, Isaiah 53:4-7, Romans 3:25, 1 John 4:10; 1 Corinthians 
                        15:3, 2 Corinthians 5:21, John 10:18, Philippians 2:8, Galatians 1:4, I Peter 2:24, 1 Peter 3:18, Isaiah 53: 11, He brews 
                        12:2, l Corinthians 15:20, Isaiah 53:12, Hebrews 9:12-15, Hebrews 7:25, 1 John 2:2).
                    </p>
                    <br />
                    <h3>Salvation</h3>
                    <p>
                        We believe that salvation isa gift from God, available to all who place their faith in Jesus Christ. Salvation 
                        cannot be earned through good works or moral purity. It is freely given by the grace of God. Jesus Christ is the only way 
                        to eternal life. Men are born into a fallen world and into a fallen flesh, and they are sinners by nature and by choice. 
                        Because of this, they are all in need of salvation. God's offer of salvation is extended to all, and it is up to every individual 
                        to either accept or reject this gift. Jesus died for every person and is not willing that any should perish. He wants to save 
                        all, but man must call upon him to be saved. Once a person is saved, they are secure in their salvation as it depends on 
                        Jesus's righteousness and not their personal righteousness. A saved believer must be careful to maintain good works. A 
                        believer works because of their salvation, not to gain salvation. John 3:16, Ephesians 2:8-9, Romans 8:38-39; Ephesians 
                        1:13-14, Ephesians 2:10, Titus 3:8.
                    </p>
                    <br />
                    <h3>Justification</h3>
                    <p>
                        We believe that justification is the act of God that takes place the moment a person places their faith 
                        in Jesus Christ. He declares a sinner to be righteous on the basis of faith in Jesus Christ. Justification involves the 
                        imputation of our sins to Christ, who bore them on the cross, and the imputation of Christ's righteousness to man. This is 
                        more than forgiveness of sin; it is a legal declaration of righteousness. The act of justification is not based on any merit or 
                        work we have done but only on Christ's merit and his finished work on the cross. It is received by faith alone. Justification 
                        provides peace with God, grants access to the privileges of being children of God and assures us of our future glorification 
                        in Christ. It is a one-time act, not a process, and once justified, a believer is eternally secure in Christ. While sanctification 
                        is the ongoing process of becoming more Christ-like, justification is the immediate change in our legal standing before 
                        God, providing the foundation for our sanctification and ultimate glorification. Romans 3:23-26, Romans 5:1- 2, 2

                    <h3>Repentance</h3>
                    <p>
                        We believe repentance has a different function in the initial experience of salvation and the ongoing
                        walk of a believer with Christ. In salvation, it is not about overcoming specific sins as commonly reported. Instead, it is
                        about turning away from idols or false securities or religion which man has trusted in for his acceptance with God, and a
                        complete faith towards God as the only hope of full salvation. This involves a reorientation of the heart and mind. The
                        person stops trusting in their own righteousness, worldly philosophies, or any other "idols" they rely on for salvation, and
                        they put their faith in Jesus Christ alone. Following salvation, repentance of sin and confession and forsaking of those
                        actions in opposition to God's commands is necessary to maintain fellowship with God and a right relationship with man.
                        This ongoing repentance is not connected to maintaining salvation; justification is a completed work based on faith in
                        Christ and needs no further activity to sustain its power. Repentance in a believer's life is part of the sanctification process.
                        A Chrisitan identifies where our heart strays and returns back to God. Acts 20:21, 1 Thessalonians 1:9, John 14:6, Romans
                        5:1, 1 John 1:9, 2 Corinthians 7:10; James 4:8-10, Romans 8:1-4
                    </p>
                    <br />
                    <h3>Faith</h3>
                    <p>
                        We believe Faith is the evidence that one believes it is his substance or proof that he believes. Faith is the 
                        confident assurance in the unseen realities of God and His promises, Faith is the entry point into a saving relationship with 
                        Jesus Christ and the sustaining force in the Christian walk. Without faith, one cannot know God. One cannot have faith in 
                        a God they do not believe exists. Faith is a gift from God; it is the means through which we are justified. While faith is 
                        accompanied by works as its evidence, these works are not the basis for our salvation but rather the natural outcome of 
                        genuine faith. When a person sees his sinful state, his hopeless situation, and dreadful future and believes that Jesu s died 
                        for him and his work alone is sufficient for salvation and stakes all his hope on Christ alone this is saving faith. Faith is 
                        what enables man to maintain good works. Hebrews 11:1-6, Ephesians 2:8-9, Romans 5:1, James 2:17-18.

                    <br />
                    <h3>The Church</h3>
                    <p>
                        The Church is a universal organism comprised of those who have been placed into the body of Christ by 
                        the Holy Spirit at salvation. This universal, spiritual body is organized by Scripture into local churches comprised of 
                        believers who have willingly submitted themselves to one another for the service of the Lord. The local church is 
                        necessary for the perfecting of the saints through Biblical preaching and teach and provoking one another to good works. 
                        The church assists the believer in carrying out the ministries God calls individual Christians to and is crucial for our 
                        perfecting and ministry to the saints. The local church is also essential for accountability and disciple ship. Without the 
                        local church, there would be no practical way to carry out church discipline or provide accountability in a believer's life. 
                        The office of the Pastor or Bishop or Elder are identical in Scripture but highlight different aspects of the office to provide 
                        care, administration, and wisdom to God's flock. The pastor is responsible for ensuring the Lord's instructions found in the 
                        Bible are followed and has authority within the body to as far as his leadership is an extension of Scripture. He is assisted 
                        by the Deacons and members in carrying out the Lord's ministry on Earth. The true mission of the church is found in 
                        glorifying God through the edification of the saints, following the Great Commission to preach the Gospel, baptize 
                        converts, and teach them to observe His commands, also known as discipleship. 1 Corinthians 12:12-27, Ephesians 4:11-
                        16, Matthew 18:15-17, Hebrews 13:17; Acts 6:1-7, Matthew 28:18-20.
                    </p>
                    <br />
                    <h3>Baptism</h3>
                    <p>
                        We believe baptism is an outward expression of an inward transformation, serving as a public declaration of 
                        one's faith in Jesus Christ and identification with Him. While it does not bring about salvation, baptism is an act of 
                        obedience that symbolizes the believer's death to sin, burial with Christ, and resurrection to new life. It is to be done in the 
                        name of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit by immersion in water. Baptism is one of the two ordinances entrusted to the 
                        local church. Matthew 28:19-20, Acts 2:38, Romans 6:3-4, Ephesians 4:4- 6, 1 Peter 3:21, 1 Corinthians 12:13, Matthew 
                        3:13-17, Acts 8:37.
                    </p>
                    <br />
                    <h3>The Lord's Supper</h3>
                    <p>
                        We believe that the Lord's Supper is the second ordinance established by Jesus Christ for the 
                        church, meant to be a time of reflection and corporate worship. Dur in g t his memorial, Members consume unleavened 
                        bread and the fruit of the vine as symbols representing Christ's body and blood. The Lord's Supper is a memorial by which 
                        believers remember the sacrificial of Christ on the cross. The believer is commanded to self-examination and repentance 
                        before partaking. The elements themselves do not become the actual body and blood of Christ; they are symbols that help 
                        us to remember and think about Christ's sacrifice. The Lord's Supper should be observed reverently and regularly by all 
                        who have placed their faith in Jesus Christ. Matthew 26:26-29, 1 Corinthia ns l l: 23-29, Luke 22:19-20, 1 Corinthians 
                        10:16 -17.
                    </p>
                    <br />
                    <h3>Eternal Security</h3>
                    <p>
                        We believe that all believers, are kept by God's power and are thus secure in Christ forever. 
                        Salvation is dependent on the work of Christ alone, and the believer is sustained by the power of God, not by works. 
                        While a believer is made perfect in Christ, this assurance should not be used as a cloak for maliciousness or as li cense to 
                        continue in sin. Christian liberty is not meant to enable a licentious life. Confident in their salvation, believers can focus 
                        on defeating sin and growing in sanctification. While sanctification may involve struggle and effort, the assurance of 
                        salvation should not be a source of continual anxiety or strife. It is abundantly clear in the New Testament that when 
                        erring, believers do not lose their salvation even if they commit as egregious a sin as fornication. John 10:28-29, Romans 
                        8:38-39, Ephesians 1:13-14, Ephesians 2:8-9, 1 Peter 2:16; Galatians 5:13-14, Romans 6:1-2, Philippians 2:12-13, 1 
                        Cor5:5.
                    </p>
                    <br />
                    <h3>Sexuality and Marriage</h3>
                    <p>
                        God created man with two distinct genders, man and woman, male and female. God 
                        has commanded that no intimate sexual activity be engaged in outside of a marriage between a naturally born man and a 
                        naturally born woman. Any form of homosexuality, lesbianism, bisexuality, pedophilia, bestiality, incest, fornication, and 
                        adultery are sinful perversions of God's gift of sex. God disapproves of and forbids any attempt to alter or renounce one's 
                        God-given male or female gender, by surgery, by appearance or by assumption of no gender, a transient gender or neutral 
                        gender. The only legitimate marriage is the joining of one naturally- born man and one naturally born woman. Abhorrent 
                        sexual behavior, that use of sexuality that in any way deviates from God's original plan of one man and one woman 
                        beginning with Adam and Eve is a perversion of God's plan for sexuality will not be tolerated within the local church 
                        property or on any church sponsored activities, or between any members of the church or staff. (Gen 2:24, Gen 19:5,13, 
                        Gen 26:8-9, Lev 18:1-30, Rom 1:26-29, I Cor 5:1, 6:9, 1 Thess 4:1-8, Heb 13:4, Rom 7:2, 1 Cor 7:10, Eph 5:22-23).
                    </p>
                    <br />
                    <h3>Church Leadership</h3>
                    <p>
                        We believe that men and women are spiritually equal in position, but that God has ordained 
                        distinct and separate spiritual functions in the home and the church. The husband is to be the leader of the home, and men 
                        are to be the leaders (pastors and deacons) of the church. Accordingly, only men are eligible for licensure and ordination 
                        by the church. (Gal. 3 :28; Col. 3: 18; 1 Tim. 2:8- 15; 3:4-5 12).
                    </p>
                    <br />
                    <h3>Family Relationships</h3>
                    <p>
                        We believe that God has ordained the family as the foundational institution of human 
                        society. The husband is to love his wife as Christ loves the church. The wife is to submit herself to the Scriptural 
                        leadership of her husband as the church submits to the headship of Christ. Children are a heritage from the Lord. Parents 
                        are responsible for teaching their children spiritual values through Bible study, prayer, consistent lifestyle examples, and 
                        appropriate discipline, including Scriptural corporal correction. (Gen. 1:26-28; Ex. 20:12; Deut. 6:4-9; Ps. 127:3-5; Prov. 
                        19:18, 22:15; 23:13-14; Mk. 10:6-12; 1 Cor. 7:1-16; Eph. 5:21-33; 6: 1-4, Col. 3:18-2 1; Heb. 13:4; 1 Pet. 3:1-7).
                    </p>

                    <h3>Family Relationships</h3>
                    <p>
                        We believe that God has ordained the family as the foundational institution of human

                        19:18, 22:15; 23:13-14; Mk. 10:6-12; 1 Cor. 7:1-16; Eph. 5:21-33; 6: 1-4, Col. 3:18-2 1; Heb. 13:4; 1 Pet. 3:1-7).

                    <br />
                    <h3>Abortions</h3>
                    <p>
                        We believe that human life begins at conception and that the unborn child is a living human being. 
                        Abortion constitutes the unjustified, unexcused taking of unborn human life. Abortion is murder. We reject any teaching 
                        that abortions due to rape, incest, birth defects, gender selection, birth or population control, or the physical or mental 
                        well being of the mother are acceptable. (Job 3:16; Ps. 51:5; 139:14-16; Isa. 44:24; 49:1, 5; Jer. 1:5; 20: 15-18; Luke 1
                        :44).

                    <h3>Lawsuits Between Believers</h3>
                    <p>
                        We believe that Christians are prohibited from bringing civil lawsuits against 
                        other Christians or the church to resolve personal disputes. We believe the church possesses all the resources necessary to 
                        resolve personal disputes between the saints. We do believe, however, that a Christian may seek compensation for injury 
                        from another Christian's insurance company as long as the claim is pursued without malice or slander. (1 Cor. 6:1-8; Eph. 
                        4:31-32; Matt. 18:15-17).
